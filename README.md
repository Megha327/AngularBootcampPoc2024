# AngularProject

Short description of my POc project:

I have developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) project using Angular version 18, centered on product management. This project incorporates various advanced features and methodologies, focusing solely on functionality and the effective use of Angular, without emphasizing styling (CSS). Key elements of the project include:

### Use of Components: 
    Modular approach through the creation and use of reusable components.
### New Control Flow: 
    Implementation of Angular's new control flow constructs such as @if, @else, and @for.
### Event Handling: 
    Effective handling of user interactions and events.
### Data Emitting: 
    Utilization of @Input and @Output decorators for parent-child component communication.
### Routing: 
    Efficient navigation and routing between different views.
### Two-way Data Binding: 
    Seamless synchronization between the model and the view.
### Forms: 
    Implementation of both template-driven and reactive forms for robust form handling.
### Service Injection: 
    Dependency injection for service management.
### Pipes: 
    Usage of pipes for data transformation and display.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive application of Angular's capabilities, emphasizing the use of directives, decorators, and advanced form techniques to manage product-related functionalities efficiently.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
